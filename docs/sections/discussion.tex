\subsection*{Technology evaluation}
Raspberry pi \\
MQTT, is very easy to setup and use. It works very well\\
Device Twin is a clear way to allow for modification of devices, even when they are offline.\\
REST ..??

\subsection*{Future work}
Future work of the system could consist of the following:\\
Using upper and lower bound for all the sensors, regarding sending/triggering alarms, as this currently only works for temperetur, and as an upper bound.\\
Additionally the prototype could be expanded with an additional Pi, to show the system running with more weather stations, this should be rather simple, as the system already includes device id's.\\ 
Data aggregation, sorting, cron job, cold storage -> big data

\todo{What would we have investigated, if we did not use all the time developing??}
