\section{Theory}
This section explains the main theories being used throughout this project. The project is to implement an IoT Environment Monitor using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a sense hat to gain some environmental measures. The data must be send to server for persistance in a database. The data must be accessible to a web application, that monitors the environmental settings. The main theories are; the Digital Twin, Message Queuing Telemetry Transfer (MQTT) and Represetational State Transfer (REST).
