\section{Theory}

[approximately 2-3 pages]. This section must contain the technical background
of the project required to understand the rest of the report. It will typically explain
the protocols being implemented, and the software/hardware/technology being used. Note
that if you have many interesting results, this is the section to slim or optionally leave out.
