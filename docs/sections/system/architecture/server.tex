The purpose of the Rest API is encapsulation and centralization of the business logic to only maintain it in one place. The API exposes services through HTTP to the App and devices and delivers data streams using server-sent-event to provide real-time data for the application to present. It enables bi-directional communication with the device trough MQTT. The REST API is a node.js server. Node.js is an extremely fast server platform in terms of I/O operations and is a very scalable server set-up which is perfect for IoT applications. The server can be implemented in javascript and can be well-structured using the express framework, which structures routing and enables a nicely structure URI hierarchy for the REST API.
