The purpose of the Rest API is encapsulation and centralization of the business logic to only maintain it in one place. The API exposes services through HTTP to the App and devices and delivers stream data. There exist an enormous amount of server-side platforms and frameworks, and the choice should depend on the application. A reasonable platform is Node.js \cite{node}. Node.js is an extremely fast server platform in terms of I/O operations and is a very scalable server set-up which is perfect for IoT applications. The server can be implemented in javascript and can be well-structured using the express framework, which structures routing and enables a nicely structure URI hierarchy for REST APIs. The server uses MQTT to enable bi-directional communication with the devices. The server provides streaming data capabilities trough the server-sent-event pattern, that is chosen for simplicity, to provide real-time data for the application to present. Web socket would probably have been the choice in a real setup, this will be elaborated upon in the discussion.
