The purpose of the server is encapsulation and centralization of the business logic to only maintain it in one place. The server should expose services through HTTP to the App and devices and delivers stream data. There exist an enormous amount of server-side platforms and frameworks, and the choice should depend on the application. A reasonable platform is Node.js \cite{node}. Node.js is an extremely fast server platform in terms of I/O operations and is a very scalable server set-up which is perfect for IoT applications. The server can be implemented in javascript and can be well-structured using the express framework \cite{express} for the REST architectural pattern, which structures routing and enables a nicely structured URI hierarchy for REST APIs. The server can use MQTT to enable bi-directional communication with the devices. Additionally the server can provide streaming data capabilities trough the Server-Sent Events (SSE) pattern, that can be chosen for simplicity over web sockets, to provide real-time data for the application to present. Optimally web sockets could be used in real setups, the choice will be elaborated upon in the discussion.
