The purpose of the server is encapsulation and centralization of the business logic to only maintain it in one place. The server should expose services through HTTP to the App and devices and deliver stream data. There exist a large selection of server-side platforms and frameworks, and the choice should depend on the application. A reasonable platform is Node.js \cite{node}. Node.js is an extremely fast server platform in terms of I/O operations and is a very scalable server set-up which is a good fit for IoT applications. The server can be implemented in javascript and can be well-structured using the express framework \cite{express} for the REST architectural pattern, which structures routing and enables a nicely structured URI hierarchy for REST APIs.
