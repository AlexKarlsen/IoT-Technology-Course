The intention of the app is to provide an application for end-users to monitor the environment on a dashboard. The dashboard should provide current state information and enable users to adjust device settings e.g. thresholds, sampling rate etc. The app could run on smart devices such as smart phone, tablet etc. in the form of a mobile app. For a proof-of-concept, a web application, that can run on most devices, would be a reasonable choice. There exist a lot of different frameworks to ease the development.  Angular \cite{angular} is a javascript/typescript framework for building app-like web applications in the form of Single Page Applications (SPA), that only requires a single page load and utilizes AJAX to request the server for data \cite{flanagan_2007}. The framework is backed by Google and is a good fit, as it has a data-driven approach. The technology is chosen due to prior experience with the platform. The framework is widely used to develop web apps and is well-suited for IoT application user interfaces e.g. dashboards etc., because of its data-driven approach where the application is fed with data from APIs.
