The device of the system is the physical weather station i.e. the IoT Device, that can monitor the environment. There exists a range of options, in order to rapidly build and showcase a prototype of this kind, like Raspberry Pi's\cite{RPI3} and Hardware Attached on Top (HATs)\cite{HATs}, which is sufficient for the goal of this project.\\

A Raspberry Pi can quickly be set up with Raspian Lite OS\cite{Raspbian}, that does not have a desktop environment, but only a command line interface, as this is sufficient for this project. The Raspberry Pi can then be equipped with a Sense HAT\cite{SenseHAT} which, amongst other things, contains a pressure-, temperature- and humidity sensor, and a 8x8 LED matrix display, supported by libraries in different programming languages.

%IoT Environment Monitor, a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspian Lite OS equipped with a sense hat sending telemetry to the server and getting device setting from server. The device application is implemented in Python 3. \todo{elaborate}
