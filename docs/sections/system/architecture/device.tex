The device of the system is the physical weather station, that can monitor the environment. There exists a range of options, in order to rapidly build and showcase a prototype of this kind, like Raspberry Pi's and HAT's, which is sufficient for the goal of this project.\\
A Raspberry Pi can quickly be set up with Raspian Lite OS, that does not have a desktop environment, but only a command line interface, as this is sufficient for this project. The Raspberry Pi can then be equipped with a Sense HAT which, amongst other things, contains a pressure-, temperature- and humidity sensor, and a 8x8 LED matrix display, supported by libraries in different programming languages.

%IoT Environment Monitor, a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspian Lite OS equipped with a sense hat sending telemetry to the server and getting device setting from server. The device application is implemented in Python 3. \todo{elaborate}
