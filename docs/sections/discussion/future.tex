\subsection*{Future work}
Future work of the system could consist of the following:\\
Using upper and lower bound for all the sensors, regarding sending/triggering alarms, as this currently only works for temperetur, and as an upper bound.\\
For the developed prototype, the server can only be requested for all the measurements. This could be modified, so the server could be queried for specific time periode, and possibly only the send the average value for a given interval. A cron job could also be made, that sometimes sorts the data.\\
The device twin could be made more complex, e.i. holding information regarding sampling rate, battery level etc.\\
Additionally the prototype could be expanded with an additional Pi, to show the system running with more weather stations, this should be rather simple, as the system already includes device id's.\\
