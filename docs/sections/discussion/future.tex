\subsection*{Future work}
Future work of the system could consist of the following:\\
Using upper and lower bound for all the sensors, regarding sending/triggering alarms, as this currently only works for temperetur, and as an upper bound.\\
Additionally the prototype could be expanded with an additional Pi, to show the system running with more weather stations, this should be rather simple, as the system already includes device id's.\\ 
Data aggregation, sorting, cron job, cold storage -> big data
