\subsection*{Design Alternatives}
The device could be expanded to a (wireless) sensor network, which then would use the Raspberry Pi as a gateway to the internet.\\
Instead of the server sending event to specific clients, when new data is received or alarms is raised, the server could be setup to just direct the information to a web socket, that client applications can listen to.\\
Alternatives to using MQTT could be AMQP or HTTP. HTTP however is not nearly as lightweight and it is document centric instead of data centric.
